Project: NaturalNumber on String

Objective
The main goals of this project are to:


Gain experience with writing a kernel class for a new type and its operations.
Develop a good understanding of specification-based test plans.
Problem
The task is to implement and rigorously test all constructors and kernel methods defined in the NaturalNumberKernel interface. We will build this using java.lang.String as the base layer. The main challenge is that any error in a kernel method can potentially affect the entire system, making debugging difficult. Adherence to the provided representation invariant and abstraction function is mandatory.


Setup
The project should be set up using the Eclipse project provided. The .zip file can be downloaded and then imported into Eclipse workspace. Detailed steps are provided in the original document.


Method
You'll need to:

Complete the createNewRep method, four constructors, and kernel methods (multiplyBy10, divideBy10, isZero) in NaturalNumber3.
Complete four constructorTest methods and four constructorRef methods in NaturalNumber3Test.
Develop a detailed test plan for the NaturalNumberKernel constructors and kernel methods, and add your test cases in NaturalNumberTest.
