Project Summary: Tag Cloud Generator
This project involves designing and coding a component-based application program from scratch. The main objective of this project is to create a tag cloud generator that reads input from a text file, generates a tag cloud of the most frequent words, and writes the output to a HTML file.

Key Features
The program requests user input for the name of an input file, the name of an output file, and the number of words to be included in the tag cloud.

The program respects the user input for the complete relative or absolute file path and will not alter it in any way.

The program checks for invalid input and relies on the SimpleReader and SimpleWriter family components to raise an error in case of conditions such as non-existent files or paths.

The input file can be any arbitrary text file.

The output is a well-formed HTML file displaying the name of the input file in a heading followed by a tag cloud of the top N words, sorted alphabetically. The font size of each word in the tag cloud is proportional to the word's frequency in the input text.

Words are defined as strings separated by whitespace or special characters.

Implementation
SimpleReader and SimpleWriter components are used for input and output operations.

The Map family components are used to keep track of the words and their counts.

The SortingMachine family components are used for sorting operations.

Setup
The project setup and sharing is done via an Eclipse project using the Subversion version control system.

Extras
The program has to sort the words first in decreasing order of count (to find the N most frequent words), and then in alphabetical order to output the tag cloud. The use of the Comparator interface is required for sorting operations.

Lastly, the output generated by your program should follow the format of a given example, which uses a CSS file (tagcloud.css) to format the tag cloud. The CSS file is expected to be in the same folder as the HTML file or provided from an external source (e.g., a web server).
